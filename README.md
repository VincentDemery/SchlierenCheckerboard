# SchlierenCheckerboard

This Python package adapts the Schlieren method to a checkerboard pattern.

SchlierenCheckerboard allows to find the shape of an interface from the
deformations of a checkerboard pattern. It is adapted from the Synthetic 
Schlieren Technique ([Moisy et al *Exp Fluids* (2009) 46:1021-1036](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00348-008-0608-z)).

SchlierenCheckerboard has been used to study the deformation of an air-water 
interface by a thin shell ([Timounay et al *arXiv* 2107.09128](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09128)). The tutorial provided in the documentation uses this work.
